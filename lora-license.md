Trained on Replicate using:

[trigger_section]

## Use it with the [ðŸ§¨ diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)

```py
from diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image
import torch

pipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained('black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev', torch_dtype=torch.float16).to('cuda')
pipeline.load_lora_weights('[hf_repo_id]', weight_name='lora.safetensors')
image = pipeline('your prompt').images[0]
```

For more details, including weighting, merging and fusing LoRAs, check the [documentation on loading LoRAs in diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/using-diffusers/loading_adapters)
