# 🌊 flux-fine-tuner

This is a [Cog](https://cog.run) training model that creates LoRA-based fine-tunes for the [FLUX.1](https://replicate.com/blog/flux-state-of-the-art-image-generation) family of image generation models.

It's live at [replicate.com/ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer](https://replicate.com/ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer).

It also includes code for running inference with a fine-tuned model.

## ✨ Features

- Automatic image captioning during training
- Image generation using the LoRA (inference)
- Optionally uploads fine-tuned weights to Hugging Face after training
- Automated test suite with [cog-safe-push](https://github.com/replicate/cog-safe-push) for continuous deployment
- Weights and biases integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're looking to create your own fine-tuned model on Replicate, you don't need to do anything with this codebase.

Check out these guides to get started:

👉 [Fine-tune Flux to create images of yourself](https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-flux-with-faces)

👉 [Fine-tune Flux with an API](https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-flux-with-an-api)

### 🔧 Cloning the Repository

This project uses git submodules. When cloning, use the `--recursive` flag:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/replicate/flux-fine-tuner.git
```

If you've already cloned the repository and encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError` (e.g., `No module named 'llava'`), run:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will fetch all necessary submodules.
